Hangman

Hangman is a game that can be played with any number of people. This version is meant to function as a single player game, with the word to be guessed being determined by the computer.

This game in particular has a functionality to randomize between two sets of words, though more can be added with ease, as well as a functionality to randomize the solution from said list.

Resetting will clear your past wins and losses, unless you reset from the end screen. This is to prevent people cheating by quitting when they are about to lose.

The only library used in this project was jQuery.

In Version 2, I would like to add more subjects, and a function with which to choose them freely.
